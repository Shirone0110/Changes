        <h1>Changes</h1>
        <div id="compare">
            In chapter 7, Cairo mainly discussed about graphs of data set that contains values and percentage or frequency of that value in the data set. Chapter 8 discussed about changes of data through a period of time.

        <h3>Pros and cons of visualization techniques</h3>
        <div id="difference">
            A simple technique that we encountered is calculating the difference between each value and the average. This technique helps compare values to the average, to easily see how we are doing compare to the goal.

            Its disadvantage is rather than comparing, I haven't found any other use of it.
        </div>
        <div id="log">
            Log transformation is another useful technique. It can transfer exponential growth or decline graph into linear graph.

            After log transformation:

            </figure>
            But it can only be used for positive data set, and it's hard to observe values such as mean, mode, or median.
        </div>
        <div id="scatter">
            Finally, connected scatter plot. It "works best when turns and swirls don't obscure the data", and is a good replacement for double-axis charts.

            But sometimes, it's just too complicated to read.
